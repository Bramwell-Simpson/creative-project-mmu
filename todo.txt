Implement collect "function" picks up a coin and adds 10 to the score - DONEEE
 - This should only be ran once when "collect()" is "called" - ensures that 10 is added
   to the score and the coin is removed from the game

Fix collision to ensure player is not able to pass through unwalkable tiles - DONEEEE
 - ChatGPT coming in clutch currently

 Add a way to switch scenes once all 3 coins have been collected - DONEEEEEEEE :3
  - IDK



things to bullshit about

had issue with switching scenes where logic would appear to be working, however it turned out that map tileset was not being overwritten as it is shared in memory between scenes
coins were difficult as score kept getting added despite coin being "deleted" fixed by just checking if player wrote collect() command and checking if it was over a coin tiles
stopping player from traveling through walls was difficult - had to simulate each step in player movement to ensure that a wall was not hit so that collision works properly
