## Prerequisites

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

It is highly recommended to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) to install Node.js and npm.

For Windows users there is [Node Version Manager for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is useful for cloning this repo locally, however this repo can be downloaded as a ZIP, then extracted.

Install Node.js and `npm` with `nvm`:

```bash
nvm install node

nvm use node
```

Replace 'node' with 'latest' for `nvm-windows`.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repository to scaffold the project like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bramwell-Simpson/creative-project-mmu.git simpson_bramwell_creativePiece
cd simpson_bramwell_creativePiece

npm install
```

Start development server:

```
npm run start
```

This will run a local server where the game will function correctly.

## Project Structure

```
    .
    ├── dist
    ├── node_modules
    ├── public
    ├── src
    │   ├── HelloWorldScene.js
    │   ├── main.js
	├── index.html
    ├── package.json
```

JavaScript files are intended for the `src` folder. `main.js` is the entry point referenced by `index.html`.

Other than that there is no opinion on how you should structure your project.

There is an example `HelloWorldScene.js` file that can be placed inside a `scenes` folder to organize by type or elsewhere to organize by function. For example, you can keep all files specific to the HelloWorld scene in a `hello-world` folder.

It is all up to you!

## Static Assets

Any static assets like images or audio files should be placed in the `public` folder. It'll then be served from the root. For example: http://localhost:8000/images/my-image.png

Example `public` structure:

```
    public
    ├── images
    │   ├── my-image.png
    ├── music
    │   ├── ...
    ├── sfx
    │   ├── ...
```

They can then be loaded by Phaser with `this.image.load('my-image', 'images/my-image.png')`.

# ESLint

This template uses a basic `eslint` set up for code linting to help you find and fix common problems in your JavaScript code.

It does not aim to be opinionated.

[See here for rules to turn on or off](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

## Dev Server Port

You can change the dev server's port number by modifying the `vite.config.js` file. Look for the `server` section:

```js
{
	// ...
	server: { host: '0.0.0.0', port: 8000 },
}
```

Change 8000 to whatever you want.
